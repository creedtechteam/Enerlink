# EnerLink

**Decentralized Smart ISP Switching + Unified Payment Gateway**  
*Built on Solana. Designed for Africa. Powered by Web3.*
---

##  Overview

EnerLink is a decentralized, smart-switching internet service layer that automatically connects users to the best-performing ISP (MTN or Airtel) based on real-time signal strength — with **no need for physical SIM swaps**.

With a single blockchain-based payment, users unlock seamless access to multiple ISPs through a censorship-resistant platform hosted on IPFS and accessed via ENS.

-  **Nouns** – ENS + IPFS Frontends  
-  **Protocol Labs** – Decentralized Hosting & Fresh Code  
-  **Wildcard** – Secure, Sovereign Systems

##  Problem and Opportunity 

In many African markets users juggle multiple SIM cards and unreliable data plans just to stay connected. This leads to:
- Manual SIM switching 
- Frequent service interuptions 
- Wasted data and rising costs 

> Over **50% of users** in target regions lack seamless, failover-ready Internet access.

##  Solution overview: EnerLink 

EnerLink solves this with a decentralized connectivity layer that:

- Automatically connects users to the strongest local network (e.g.,MTN vs. AIRTEL)
- Enables tokenized, pay-per-KB billing via Solana smart contracts
- Hosts the frontend on IPFS and resolves with ENF for censorship resistance.

##  Getting Started

Coming soon: detailed setup instructions for local dev, testnet interaction, and switching simulation.

To test EnerLink locally:

 1. Clone the frontend
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend-repo.git
cd frontend-repo

 2. Install dependencies
npm install

 3. Run locally
npm run dev

Contract deployment and backend setup instructions will be added once Solana testnet deployment is live.
